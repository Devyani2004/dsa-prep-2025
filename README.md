------


### tasks for June 22nd 

####  Sorting Basics
    - Studied:
        - Bubble Sort
        - Selection Sort
        - Insertion Sort
    - Understood time and space complexities
    - Implemented all three in C++

####  Sorting Practice Problems
    - Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag Problem)  https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/submissions/1672453475/
    - Merge Sorted Array  https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/submissions/1672479591/
    - Array is Sorted and Rotated https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/submissions/1673501355/

-----

### Tasks for June 23rd
#### Recap (Basic Sorting): (revised)

    - Selection Sort
    
    - Bubble Sort
    
    - Insertion Sort

#### Learn:
    
     - Merge Sort (Recursive Implementation)
    
     - Quick Sort (Recursive + Partition Logic)

##### Practice Problems:

     - Implemented Merge Sort on an integer array
    
     - Implemented Quick Sort on an integer array
    
     - Leetcode 56 – Merge Intervals https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/submissions/1675721062/
    
     - Count Inversions using Merge Sort 

--------

### June 25th and 26th – Advanced Sorting & Intervals
##### Recap:
    - Merge Sort
    
    - Quick Sort
    
    - Leetcode 56 – Merge Intervals

#### New Concepts to Learn:

  1. Sorting + Greedy Patterns:
    
    - Activity Selection Problem completed
    
    - Interval Scheduling Maximum
    
    - Minimum Number of Platforms (Train Problem)
    
  2. Advanced Intervals:
     
    Insert Interval
    
    Meeting Rooms I & II
    
    Non-overlapping Intervals
  
 ##### Problems to Practice:
    Topic	Problem	Platform
    Greedy + Sorting	Leetcode 452 – Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons	Leetcode
    Intervals	Leetcode 57 – Insert Interval	Leetcode
    Intervals	Leetcode 253 – Meeting Rooms II	Leetcode
    Greedy	N meetings in one room – GFG	GFG

--------


### 29th June: 
#### What i did today
    - Today I revised Queues and Linked List.
    - Did some questions of recursion
    - The tasks of 25th June are still pending, will complete them tomorrow.

------

### June 30th:
#### 1. Revised:
     - two pointers
     - sliding window technique
  
#### 2. Learned:
     - Backtracking
     
  

#### June month refection: I dont think so that I have done enough this month I have procrastinated a lot, a lot of things came up and I was not able to do. 
    - It's July now and I am goig to follow a proper schedule now and in this month I'll focus on core DSA and CS Fundamentals
